# cron jobs, not microservices.

ðŸš¨ this file is chaos. don't clean it yet. just keep adding shit.

---

ðŸ§  brain dump:

- match ingestion every 15 min â€” should be idempotent.
- scoring script (post-match) â†’ needs reliable trigger.
- payout executor = not cron? maybe pub/sub or manual? needs thinking.

---

ðŸ•’ what needs cron rn:

[] fetch matches from provider
[] mark contest status: upcoming â†’ live â†’ locked â†’ completed
[] scoring + payouts
[] reconcile wallets (maybe daily, maybe hourly?)
[] refund failed contests

---

questions:

- do we need a scheduler lib or just raw `sleep + while` for now?
- where do we log fails? cloudwatch? s3 bucket of shame?
- can we test these end-to-end with fake match IDs?

future me: please don't dockerize this yet. it's not worth it.
