# fantasy-infra-sim

infra + service notes from a real-money fantasy sports backend I helped build between Jan 2024 â€“ mid 2025.

this isnâ€™t prod code â€” just internal documentation and scattered brain dumps.

## what's here

- `docs/`: flow diagrams, service notes, infra sketches
- `services/`: auth, wallet, scoring â€” rough service summaries
- `infra/`: terraform stubs (never finished, lol)
- `postmortem.md`: the 1.2L refund incident ðŸ’€
- `experiments/`: abandoned leaderboard refactor
- `adr/`: fake-but-real ADRs for infra structure

## why this exists

trying to open-source parts of my infra work (under NDA) in a sanitized way  
for blog posts, future projects, or just to remember what I did.

none of this is runnable â€” itâ€™s vibes + system-level storytelling.
