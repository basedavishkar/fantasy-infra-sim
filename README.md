## Modules

- KYC + onboarding
- Wallet + contest locking
- Match ingestion + scoring
- Payments + reconciliation

## Why this exists

Built during a freelance contract across 2024. Infra handled 1M+ wallet tx/day at peak.

This repo simulates structure + decision logic used in prod, not complete code.
