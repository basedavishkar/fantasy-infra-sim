# System Architecture Overview

This backend infra simulated the real-money fantasy app I consulted for.

## Notes

- All services were containerized (ECS)
- Event-driven parts used Redis pub/sub
- Scoring relied on post-match CSVs â†’ ingested via signed S3 uploads
- Payouts used async task queues (via Celery back then)
